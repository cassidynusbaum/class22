                <p>Parmesan</p>
                <p>I went to buy pizza at Domino Pizza.<br/>
                    I was greeted by Ms. Nataly Guzman.<br/>
                    Ms. Guzman was so pleasant and accommodating.<br/>
                    I had my order on time.<br/>
                    She's very attentive to details.<br/> 
                    Definitely will come back.

                <h2>Top Negative Review</h2>
                <p>Lies</p>
                <p>Months ago I posted a review about and order I had out in.<br/>
                   I was disappointed with the service I received and on my review<br/>
                   the owner reached out apologizing for it. He offered me a<br/>
                   free pie that I would just have to wait a short time for.<br/>
                   Wellll here we are months later and still nothing.<br/>
                   Don't say you are going to do something for your paying<br/>
                   customers and leave them high and dry. Just horrible
